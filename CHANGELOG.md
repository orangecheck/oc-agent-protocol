# Changelog

All notable changes to the OC Agent Protocol specification.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04

### Added

- **`LIFECYCLE.md`** — normative companion document specifying per-kind lifecycles for delegation (30083), action (30084), and revocation (30085). Clarifies that actions are themselves non-revocable (only future actions on a delegation are denied by kind-30085, never past ones — priority via OTS anchor per `SPEC.md` §9.3); that revocations are themselves non-revocable (re-grant by publishing a new delegation); and that bond withdrawal works via UTXO spend with re-resolution at action-evaluation time per `SPEC.md` §8 / `E_BOND_UNVERIFIED`. Reaffirms that dashboard-local hide flags and NIP-09 deletion-request events have no protocol force. No protocol changes; clarification only.

### Changed

- **`SPEC.md` §3, §10, §16** — kind 30083 is now documented as **co-claimed** with [OC Stamp](https://github.com/orangecheck/oc-stamp-protocol). OC Agent uses `d`-tag prefix `oc-agent-del:`; OC Stamp uses `oc-stamp:`. The two are runtime-unambiguous via disjoint `d`-tag namespaces, distinct `event.tags` shape, and the envelope's internal `kind` field. Verifiers querying kind 30083 alone (no `#d` filter) MUST inspect envelope `kind` after fetching. No wire-format change; clarifies family-level reality. Companion change in `oc-stamp-protocol` mirrors this acknowledgement.
- **`SPEC.md` §7.3** — added an `Example scope string` column to the registered MVP scopes table, illustrating realistic constraint-list syntax for each of the 8 registered verbs (`lock:seal`, `lock:chat`, `stamp:sign`, `vote:cast`, `nostr:publish`, `http:request`, `ln:send`, `mcp:invoke`). No grammar change; readers no longer need to mentally fuse §7.3 + §7.6 to picture a real scope.

- **`test-vectors/`** — added 4 negative vectors and the negative-vector schema. The original 5 vectors all asserted canonical-message round-trip (positive path); the new vectors assert specific verifier rejections per §8.1 / §11:
  - `v06-action-scope-denied.json` — action exercises a recipient not granted by v01 → `E_SCOPE_DENIED` (§8.1 step 12, §7.4).
  - `v07-action-out-of-window.json` — action signed after v01's `expires_at` → `E_OUT_OF_WINDOW` (§8.1 step 11).
  - `v08-revocation-unauthorized-signer.json` — revocation of v01 signed by the agent address (not in `revocation.holders`) → `E_REVOKER_UNAUTHORIZED` (§9.2, §8.1 step 7).
  - `v09-delegation-malformed-scope.json` — delegation with a scope string missing its operator (`recipient bc1q…` instead of `recipient=bc1q…`) → `E_BAD_SCOPE_GRAMMAR` (§7.1, §8.1 step 4); plus 5 additional malformed-scope examples for implementer smoke-test coverage (no verb, empty parens, empty value, case violation, ordered-op with non-integer).
  - `test-vectors/README.md` documents the negative-vector schema (`"negative": true`, `expected.error_code`, `expected.spec_reference`, `harness_assertion`) so new vectors of either flavor can be added consistently.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04

Initial release of the OC Agent Protocol specification.

### Added

- Delegation envelope (`kind: "agent-delegation"`, Nostr kind 30083) — principal-signed grant of scoped authority to an agent address, bounded by expiry and optional OrangeCheck-referenced bond.
- Agent-action envelope (`kind: "agent-action"`, Nostr kind 30084 shared with OC Stamp) — agent-signed exercise of a delegation. Strict extension of [OC Stamp v1](https://github.com/orangecheck/oc-stamp-protocol) with `delegation_id` and `scope_exercised` fields.
- Revocation envelope (`kind: "agent-revocation"`, Nostr kind 30085) — principal- or agent-signed termination of a delegation, OTS-anchorable for priority ordering.
- Scope grammar (§SPEC 7) — compact declarative `<product>:<verb>(<constraint-list>)` strings with a deterministic sub-scope relation. MVP registry of 8 scopes: `lock:seal`, `lock:chat`, `stamp:sign`, `vote:cast`, `nostr:publish`, `http:request`, `ln:send`, `mcp:invoke`.
- Full verification algorithm (§SPEC 8) — offline, pure-function of envelopes + Nostr + Bitcoin headers. No ochk.io endpoint required at verify time.
- Security model and threat analysis (`SECURITY.md`), covering 13 in-scope threats (T1–T13) and the implementation requirements for compliant libraries.
- Error code registry (§SPEC 11) with 17 codes.
- Test-vectors directory scaffold for cross-implementation conformance.

### Notes

- OC Agent composes with every sibling in the OrangeCheck stack: OrangeCheck attestations supply the bond; OC Lock can wrap sensitive delegations and action payloads; OC Stamp's canonical-message discipline underlies the agent-action envelope; OC Vote provides a registered `vote:cast` scope.
- Anchoring is optional but strongly recommended for any high-stakes delegation — priority ordering against revocations requires OTS.
- Nostr kind 30084 is shared transport between OC Stamp and OC Agent actions; disambiguation is by envelope `kind`. Kind 30083 (delegation) is co-claimed with OC Stamp under disjoint `d`-tag prefixes (see Unreleased note); kind 30085 (revocation) is claimed exclusively by this spec.
